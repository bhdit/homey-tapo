# Enhanced Support for Tapo Devices

This update introduces expanded functionality specifically tailored for Tapo devices.
While the work is preliminary and has so far been extensively tested only with the
L930 model, strides are being made to encompass a broader range of devices.

One of the big wins with this new addition is the ability to communicate locally.
This means streamlined, fast, and secure connections right at your fingertips.

To ensure a seamless user experience, the app requires your Tapo username and password
to connect with the device. It's recommended to add these details within the app
settings prior to making an attempt to add a device. This proactive step will
allow for an easy and efficient set up process.


Currently, the app utilizes MAC discovery. If a device's MAC isn't on the list, you can
manually input its IP address in the settings. This approach is part of an effort
to minimize reliance on cloud services.

New and in testing drivers:
 - Device L900
 - Device L510
 - Discover by IP set in settings
