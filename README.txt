# Enhanced Support for Tapo Devices

This update introduces expanded functionality specifically tailored for Tapo devices. While the work is preliminary and has so far been extensively tested only with the L930 model, strides are being made to encompass a broader range of devices.

One of the big wins with this new addition is the ability to communicate locally. This means streamlined, fast, and secure connections right at your fingertips.

To ensure a seamless user experience, the app requires your Tapo username and password to connect with the device. It's recommended to add these details within the app settings prior to making an attempt to add a device. This proactive step will allow for an easy and efficient set up process.

At present, the application has access to the first half of the MAC address tied to my Tapo device. Efforts are underway to enhance this discovery method. Stay tuned for more updates as we continually strive to improve this functionality for an even more reliable and efficient user experience.
